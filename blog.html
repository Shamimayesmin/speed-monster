                  <strong>Global Scope :</strong> Variables defined outside any function, block, or module scope have global scope. Variables in global scope can be accessed from everywhere in the application.

                  When a module system is enabled itâ€™s harder to make global variables, but one can still do it. By defining a variable in HTML, outside any function, a global variable can be created:

                <div class="accordion-body">
                  <strong>Block Scope :</strong>Block scope is defined with curly braces. It is separated by { and }.

                  Variables declared with let and const can have block scope. They can only be accessed in the block in which they are defined.
                  Consider the next code that emphasizes let block scope:

                        let x = 1;
                        { 
                        let x = 2;
                        }
                        console.log(x); //1
                </div>

                    JavaScript is a single-threaded synchronous programming language,
                    an event loop is a programming construct that allows a program to handle multiple events or tasks simultaneously. It works by having the program keep track of all the events or tasks that need to be processed, and then processing them one by one as they come in. This can be a very efficient way to handle a lot of events or tasks, as it prevents the program from getting bogged down by having to process everything at once.

                    In JavaScript, "undefined" is a global variable (a property of the global object), that is created at run time. Undefined means a variable has been declared, but the value of that variable has not yet been defined . Also, when you do not supply an argument for a function parameter, it will have the value of "undefined" . Furthermore, when a function does not return a value, it returns "undefined". It is one of JavaScript's primitive types .
